I Need to simulate the Managment of User Scenario (Add then Delete) at OrangeHRM website:

1-  Given I Navigate to URL
2- When I Enter Valid user Name and Password
3- And I Click on Login button
4- And I Click on Admin Tab
5- And I Get Count of Records
6- And I Click on Add button
7- And I Fill Mandatory Information
8- And I Back to Users Grid
9- Then Verify Users added Successfully
10- When I Search For User
11- And I Click on Delete
12- Then Verify Number of Users decreased Successfully

Notes:
I am use Cucumber, Selenium with Java, Maven and Junit.

1- Config File (Contain URL,User Name and Password)
2- ResourcesFile (Contain all Paths I need it to Execute Scenario)

Maven Dependency:
